### Machine Language (low level language).
    - very difficult to understand by the users.
    - The only language which can be understood by the computer.
    - All the instructions of machine language are written in the form of binary numbers 1's & 0's.

### Assembly Language (middle level language).
    - Difficult to understand by the users.
    - Instructions are created using symbols such as letters, digits and special characters.
    - We use predefined words called mnemonics.
    - We use a translator called Assembler to translate mnemonics into machine language.

### High Level Language
    - Can be understood by the users.
    - Set of predefined words known as Keywords and a set of rules known as Syntax to create instructions.
    - Needs to be converted into the low-level language to make it understandable by the computer.
    - We use (Compiler or interpreter) to convert high-level language to low-level language.
    - EX: Java, C++, C#.......etc.
